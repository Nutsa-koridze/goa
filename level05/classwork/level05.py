#task1

# we declared int type variable and it name num, value is 20 
num = 20
# we have reassigned a value for variable to 15
num = 15

# reassing works this way: if we declare one variable name multiple times, it will display the last one

print(num)

#task2


# 1. snake_case
# 2. case-sansitive
# 3. comments

# 1. we use snake_case to make easier to read variable wich contains multiple words, programists discused and disided to use snake_case in python

dog_name="Jack"

# 2. if languige is case-sensitive, that means that "a" and "A" are diferent symbols, 
# if we dont pay attancion to them, our code can resalt ain error

name = "data"

print(Name)

# 3. we use comments to explain and give discribtion to our code, to make it easier to read and understand

# we use build in print function to display "Hello world!" on the screen
print("Hello world!")
